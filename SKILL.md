# Subjectivity Truth Check

Evaluate whether someone has truly appropriated a truth—made it their own through passionate commitment—or merely acknowledges it as information. Test the subjective relationship to beliefs.

---

## When to Use

- Someone states a belief but seems disconnected from it
- User asks "Do I really believe this?" or "Is this my truth?"
- Testing conviction before a major commitment
- When beliefs and actions diverge
- Distinguishing genuine faith from nominal belief
- Someone asks "Test my conviction" or "Challenge what I claim to believe"
- Evaluating the difference between knowing and existing

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| belief | Yes | The belief, truth, or conviction being examined |
| evidence | No | How this belief manifests (or doesn't) in their life |
| sacrifice | No | What they have or would sacrifice for this belief |

## The Kierkegaardian Framework

### "Subjectivity is Truth"

Kierkegaard's famous statement is widely misunderstood. He is NOT saying:
- Truth is whatever you feel it is (subjectivism)
- There are no objective facts
- Belief makes things true

He IS saying:
- Truth must be *appropriated*—made one's own through passionate commitment
- Objective truth without subjective relation is mere information
- The *how* of believing matters as much as the *what*
- "It is the relationship of the individual to the truth that is decisive"

### The Difference That Makes a Difference

Consider two people who both "believe" in honesty:
- Person A affirms honesty is important, then lies when convenient
- Person B stakes their existence on honesty, suffers for it, cannot lie even when it costs them

Both "believe" the same proposition. But only Person B has *appropriated* the truth. Person A has information; Person B has conviction.

### The Test: What Would You Sacrifice?

The question that reveals appropriation: *What would you sacrifice for this truth?*

If the answer is "nothing"—if the belief can be abandoned whenever inconvenient—it was never truly held. It was acknowledged, not appropriated.

Kierkegaard writes: *"I must find a truth that is true for me... the idea for which I can live and die."*

### Knowledge vs. Existence

There is knowledge *about* something and there is knowledge *by* existing in relationship to it.

One can know about Christianity—its history, doctrines, arguments—without being a Christian. Being a Christian is not having correct information but staking one's existence on a relationship.

The same applies to any conviction: justice, love, purpose, meaning. One can know about these things without living them.

## The Examination Workflow

### Step 1: State the Belief Clearly

What truth does the person claim to hold? Make it explicit:
- "I believe X"
- "I am committed to Y"
- "I know Z to be true"

### Step 2: Examine the Evidence

How does this belief manifest in their life?

**Signs of appropriation:**
- The belief shapes daily decisions
- It costs them something to maintain it
- They struggle with it (engagement, not comfort)
- Their life would be unrecognizable without it
- Others can see it in their actions

**Signs of mere acknowledgment:**
- The belief is held "in principle" but rarely applied
- It costs them nothing
- They feel certain without struggle (certainty is cheap)
- Their life would be the same without it
- It appears only in speech, not action

### Step 3: The Sacrifice Test

Ask: *What have you sacrificed for this belief?*

And: *What would you sacrifice if required?*

If the belief has cost nothing and would cost nothing, it is not appropriated. It is a decoration, not a foundation.

### Step 4: Check the How

Even true beliefs can be held wrongly:
- **Indifferently:** "I suppose that's true"
- **Comfortably:** "Of course that's true"—no friction
- **Passionately:** "This is true and I stake my life on it"

The same proposition held indifferently is different from the same proposition held passionately. The how transforms the what.

### Step 5: Name the Gap

If there is distance between stated belief and lived existence, name it without judgment:
- What does the person say they believe?
- What does their life say they believe?
- Where is the divergence?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Subjectivity Truth Check: [The Belief]

### The Stated Belief
"[Exact statement of what they claim to believe]"

### Evidence Examined

**Signs of Appropriation:**
- [List any evidence the belief is truly held]

**Signs of Mere Acknowledgment:**
- [List any evidence the belief is only nominally held]

### The Sacrifice Test
**What has been sacrificed:** [What, if anything]
**What would be sacrificed:** [Their answer or inference]

**Assessment:** [Appropriated / Partially Appropriated / Acknowledged Only]

### The How of Believing
How is this belief held?
- [Indifferently / Comfortably / Passionately / With struggle]

### The Gap
**What they say they believe:** [X]
**What their life demonstrates they believe:** [Y]
**The distance between them:** [Describe the gap]

### The Question That Remains
[A question that probes the gap without attacking—inviting deeper examination]

*"It is the relationship of the individual to the truth that is decisive."*
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not attack or shame—the goal is clarity, not judgment
- Recognize that partial appropriation is human and normal
- Avoid reducing this to "hypocrisy detection"—everyone has gaps
- The point is not to catch someone but to help them see
- Do not claim to know better than they do; ask questions that let them see
- Remember: Kierkegaard examined himself this way and found himself wanting

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I believe in living authentically—being true to yourself, not conforming to what others expect. That's really important to me."

Evidence: They work a job they hate because it's respectable. They stay in a social circle they don't enjoy. They haven't made a significant life choice based on what they actually want in years.

**Output:**

## Subjectivity Truth Check: "Living Authentically"

### The Stated Belief
"I believe in living authentically—being true to yourself, not conforming to what others expect. That's really important to me."

### Evidence Examined

**Signs of Appropriation:**
- The belief is articulated with apparent conviction
- They identify it as "really important"
- They hold it as a stated value

**Signs of Mere Acknowledgment:**
- Work chosen for respectability, not authenticity
- Social circle maintained despite not enjoying it
- No significant choice based on "what they actually want" in years
- The belief appears only as stated value, not lived practice
- Conformity to expectations continues despite contrary belief

### The Sacrifice Test
**What has been sacrificed:** Nothing apparent. The job, social circle, and life choices all conform to external expectations.

**What would be sacrificed:** Unclear. The belief exists at no cost to maintain and might be abandoned if tested.

**Assessment:** Acknowledged Only

This belief about authenticity is *held* but not *lived*. It is a truth acknowledged in principle while its opposite is practiced in existence.

### The How of Believing
This belief is held **comfortably**—as a pleasant self-image, a story told about oneself. There is no friction between the stated belief and daily life because the belief is never allowed to make demands.

If the belief made demands—if authenticity required leaving the respectable job, the pleasant social circle—would it survive?

### The Gap
**What they say they believe:** Living authentically is really important
**What their life demonstrates they believe:** Respectability and social belonging are really important; authenticity is optional

**The distance between them:** The stated belief and the lived belief contradict each other completely. One or the other must be mistaken. Either authenticity is not actually important to them, or they are in despair—unable to will to be themselves.

### The Question That Remains
You say authenticity is "really important." But your job, your relationships, your recent choices all follow the path of conformity.

This leaves two possibilities:
1. Authenticity is not actually important to you—you only think it should be
2. Authenticity IS important to you, and you are not living

Which is it?

I am not asking to trap you. I am asking because until you know which is true, you cannot address either.

*"The most common form of despair is not being who you are."*

What would it cost you to live as if authenticity were actually important? And why have you not paid that price?

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Soren Kierkegaard** expert persona. It pairs well with:
- **existential-stage-diagnosis** — understanding the stage where belief-action gaps occur
- **despair-diagnosis** — when the gap reveals a form of despair
- **socratic-elenchus** — for deeper examination of what the person claims to know
